# binary_search_tree

**What this is?**

A binary tree is a type of data structure where each node has at most 2 children, in addition each node holds some data
(in this case Integers). A binary search tree takes this structure and orders the nodes so that all values in a node are larger then 
those stored in the left subtree and are smaller then those stored in the right subtree.

**Functionality of the program**

  - Able to generate a binary search tree from a uniquely sorted array of integers.
  - The ability to insert and delete notes from the tree.
  - The ability to find the node of a specific integer in the tree (if it exists).
  - The ability to print the tree's values in preorder, inorder and postorder format.
  - The ability to determine a nodes height from the lowest leaf node.
  - Along with being able to determine the depth of the node from the tree's root node.
  - The ability to check if the tree is balanced and a function to rebalance the tree.

**What I've learned**

  - A stronger understanding of recursive algorithims.
  - Made frequent use of and improved understanding of my debugger.
